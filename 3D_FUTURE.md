## 1. Overview

The 3D CAD shapes in current 3D benchmarks are mostly collected from online model repositories. Thus, they typically have insufficient geometric details and less informative textures, making them less attractive for comprehensive and subtle research in areas such as high-quality 3D mesh and texture recovery. We presents 3D Furniture shape with TextURE ([3D-FUTURE](https://tianchi.aliyun.com/specials/promotion/alibaba-3d-future)): a richly-annotated and large-scale repository of 3D furniture shapes in the household scenario. 3D-FUTURE contains 20,240 clean and realistic synthetic images of 5,000 different rooms. There are 16,563 unique detailed 3D instances of furniture with high-resolution textures. Experienced designers developed the room scenes, and the 3D CAD shapes in the scene are used for industrial production. More details can be found in our <a href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.09633.pdf?spm=5176.14208604.0.0.78253cf77YoOGy&file=2009.09633.pdf'>report</a>.

## 2. Data Description
3D-FUTURE provides 20,240 realistic indoor images and the associated 16,563 unique 3D furniture models with rich geometry details and informative textures. We render these images via one of the most advanced industrial 3D rendering engines based on 5,000 exquisite room scenes developed by experienced designers. The 3D furniture shapes are used for modern industrial productions and havefine-grained geometry and texture related attributes such as category, style, theme, and material. Further, 3D-FUTURE offers instance segmentation annotation and the rendering information, including six degrees of freedom (6DoF) pose and camera field of view (FoV).
